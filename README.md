Education on Mars - A selective knowledge base

Launching #DreamBig's Mars Project. Join the moonshot open source project to develop the knowledge base for survival and settlement of Humans on Mars.

In this 21st century, we on Earth, take some basic building blocks for granted. We don't stop to contemplate, the origins of structure, stability and raw material, much less, remember the origin of fire, the first farming animal, the first farmed crop or clothing.

When the first batch of humans arrive at Mars, they will be a hand picked group that achieve the IQ, skill set and physical health endurance qualifiers. However, they will still need access to a knowledge base that will help them develop the planet for human settlement. We can't expect to send people with every possible skill set. This selected group may most likely have a super-set of skills or best-fit skills. It will be like kindling a fire from a scratch, without wood or matchsticks. How will they achieve this?

Questions:
1. What education modules will they need to get them started? 
2. Would these be youtube like videos that they can play to follow step by step guidelines? or will these be neuro transmitters that program brain memory cells with enhanced knowledge base?
3. Would these be downloaded by line of sight communication between Earth Satellites and the spaceship? 
4. It will be several years before the first Mars spacecraft, with the first payload of passengers arrive on the red planet. Will the passengers spend time upgrading their skill sets through education modules during the journey, as more research data is sent to them?

These and several questions exist!

##DreamBig is looking not just for answers but more viable questions to formulate the problem statements that will need solving, on our journey to Mars.
